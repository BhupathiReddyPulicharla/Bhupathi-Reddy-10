There are five main components to a Ribbon; QAT (Quick Access Toolbar), tabs, command buttons, groups of command buttons, and dialog launchers.
When evaluating a formula, Excel follows a standard math protocol called "order of operations". In general, Excel's order of operation follows the acronym PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication, Division, Addition, Subtraction) but with some customization to handle the formula syntax in a spreadsheet.
When you combine several operations and functions into a single formula, Excel performs the operations in a predetermined order, known as the order of operations. When a formula contains several operators with the same precedence, Excel calculates the formula from left to right.There are four different types of calculation operators: arithmetic, comparison, text concatenation, and reference.
A formula in Excel always begins with an equal sign (=). Excel interprets the characters that follow the equal sign as a formula. Following the equal sign are the elements to be calculated (the operands), such as constants or cell references.
PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication, Division, Addition, Subtraction) but with some customization to handle the formula syntax in a spreadsheet.
Excel calculates formulas based on the following order of operations: Operations enclosed in parentheses. Exponential calculations (3^2, for example) Multiplication and division, whichever comes first.
Given a string, write a python function to check if it is palindrome or not. A string is said to be palindrome if the reverse of the string ...
The easiest way to find if a given String is Palindrome or not is by writing a recursive function to reverse the String first and then comparing the given String with the reversed String, if both are equal then the given String is a palindrome.

n Microsoft Excel, the Name Box displays the cell that is currently selected in the spreadsheet. It is located to the left of the formula bar. If a name is defined for a cell that is selected, the Name Box displays the name of the cell. You can use the Name Box to define a name for a selected cell, as well.
In Excel, the Name Box refers to an input box directly to the left of the formula bar. The Name Box normally displays the address of the "active cell" on the worksheet. You can also use the name box to quickly create a named range. Another use for the Name Box is to navigate quickly to any range in a worksheet.
